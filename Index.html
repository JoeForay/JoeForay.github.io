                <p>
                    Because of how easily Covid can spread, patients need to be isolated from people that do not have the virus to stop the spread. Our solution should make good use of the limited housing that is available and keep Covid patients away from healthy students/staff.

                        My group and I worked together and discussed all of the possible ways that we would be able to limit the spread of the virus by the patients while still trying to attend to the patients needs.
